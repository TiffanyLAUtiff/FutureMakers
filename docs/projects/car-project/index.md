# Vehicle Design and Aerodynamics Project

---

## Abstract

This is a hands-on, project-based course that guides you through the process of creating a customized 3D car model using AI tools, refining it in Nomad Sculpt, 3D printing it, and transforming it into a fully functional 4WD remote-controlled (RC) vehicle. The course combines creative design, digital modeling, physical prototyping, and basic electronics.

## What You Will Learn

- How to use AI tools to generate 3D models of vehicles

- Techniques to import, clean, and refine models using Nomad Sculpt

- Customization of car components like bumpers, skirts, spoilers, etc.

- Preparing and slicing models for 3D printing

- Basics of 3D printing and post-processing techniques

- How to assemble and wire an RC 4WD chassis

- Presenting and testing your final product

## Project Steps

### 1. Generating the 3D Model

**Objective**: Create an initial 3D car model using AI tools.

**Content**:
1. Learn and practice AI prompts and generate a blank car model using ChatGPT
2. Use Tripo AI to generate a 3D model:
   - Upload your reference image
   - Adjust generation parameters as needed
   - Download the generated 3D model

### 2. Model Modification

**Objective**: Customize the car model's appearance.

**Content**:
1. Import the generated model into Nomad Sculpt
2. Remesh the model(Preferrably Quad Remesh Tool)
3. Learn about basic car customisation options
4. Use basic modification tools:
   - Masking tool for maintaining certain parts
   - Move and Drag tool for reshaping windshield and overall shape
   - Clay for skirts, fender and smooth it
   - Clay, move and smooth for front bumper and rear bumper
   - Use Primitives and trim tool for spoilers
   - Smooth tool for evening out rough spots

### 3. Preparing for 3D Printing

**Objective**: Export the 3D model for printing.

**Content**:
1. Export model from Nomad in STL format
2. Import into slicer software:
   - Adjust model orientation for optimal printing
   - Add support structures
   - Configure print settings (layer height, infill, etc.)
3. Generate G-code and print

### 4. Post-processing, assembly and test running
1. Remove support structures
2. sand the surfaces and support structure marks
3. Assemble the car cover onto the Chassis and Beets motor unit
