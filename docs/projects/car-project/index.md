# Vehicle Design and Aerodynamics Project

---

## Abstract

This course explores the exciting intersection of technology, design, and aerodynamics, offering students a hands-on learning experience that spans 3D scanning, model modification, 3D printing, and wind tunnel testing. Through structured lessons, students will engage in the research and development process of vehicle design, from conceptualization to testing and iteration.

Younger students will focus on aesthetics, while older students delve deeper into aerodynamics principles, fostering age-appropriate learning. The program emphasizes critical skills such as design thinking, problem-solving, and iterative development, empowering students to refine their prototypes based on performance data.

By the end of the course, students will present their design process, analyze wind tunnel results, and race their vehicles in a friendly competition. The course aims to inspire creativity and spark interest in engineering through real-world applications, culminating in a deeper understanding of modern vehicle design and aerodynamics principles.
