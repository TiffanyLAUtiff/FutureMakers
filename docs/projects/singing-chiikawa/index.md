## What is this?

The "Chiikawa Project" is a hands-on learning activity that combines digital sculpting and character creation. Students will use the professional 3D modeling application Nomad Sculpt to start with basic shapes and follow simple, easy-to-understand steps. Even beginners can quickly grasp digital sculpting techniques and gradually create a 3D model of the popular character "Chiikawa." The final goal is to export the 3D file, complete 3D printing, and add color to the model.

This project not only allows students to explore the core concepts of 3D modeling and character design but also provides hands-on experience in digital modeling tools and 3D techniques. Through this process, students develop spatial awareness, digital creativity, and technical confidence.

## Key Features

- Popular character theme enhances student engagement and motivation.

- Combination of digital modeling, creative design, and physical output for a complete artistic workflow.

- Clear steps and intuitive operations make it easy for beginners to get started.

- Encourages original character modeling and application extensions to foster creativity and interdisciplinary thinking.

This project offers an engaging and technically rich creative experience, helping students build foundational 3D modeling skills while laying the groundwork for future innovations.

## What you will learn?

By participating in the Chiikawa 3D Modeling Project, students will learn how to transform a 2D character design into a fully realized 3D model from scratch. Through hands-on activities, they will develop the following skills and knowledge:

**Digital Modeling & Sculpting Skills**

- Use Nomad Sculpt's basic tools (Gizmo, Move, Smooth) to shape and refine models.

- Master symmetrical modeling, assembling components, and shape transformation techniques.

- Understand 3D model structure and proportion distribution to cultivate spatial awareness and observation skills.

**Character Design & Visual Expression**

- Learn to use reference images to design character shapes and build structural details.

- Practice facial expressions and body features in sculpting to enhance artistic expression and individual style.

**Digital-to-Physical Workflow**

- Master the conversion process from a digital model to a 3D print file (.stl/.obj).

- Learn how to merge components (Boolean operations), export files, and perform pre-printing checks.

- Experience post-processing after printing, including coloring and assembly.

**Interdisciplinary Integration & Creative Applications**

- Optional: Combine the Micro:bit control module to explore basic interactive technology integration.

- Encourage creative expansion and customization of character designs to inspire innovation and aesthetic development.

This project is not just about learning how to use 3D modeling tools—it is about mastering the entire creative process from concept to physical production, providing a strong foundation for future explorations in animation, game design, product prototyping, and more.

## How it works

The modeling process consists of the following steps:

1. **Preparation & Setup**: Launch Nomad Sculpt, create a new project, and import Chiikawa reference images, starting with a sphere for the head.

2. **Basic Modeling**: Use Nomad Sculpt's sculpting tools to adjust the character's head, body, ears, tail, and limbs, utilizing common modeling features to ensure consistent structure.

3. **Detail Sculpting**: Use sculpting tools to refine facial features like eyes and mouth, adding depth to the character.

4. **Assembly Design**: Further design the character's component parts and assembly methods, preparing for 3D printing.

5. **Completion & Export**: Check the overall model, merge components, and export as .stl or .obj file format, completing the final steps before printing.

6. **Optional Features**: Choose to add Micro:bit module for interactivity and technological elements.

7. **Physical Coloring**: After printing, perform sanding and coloring to complete your unique Chiikawa figurine.

## Design

This project uses the Chiikawa character as its theme, combining popular culture with digital modeling to enhance student motivation. Through imitation and creation, students not only learn modeling techniques but also develop creative thinking and design abilities.

## Assembly Guide

As this project focuses primarily on digital modeling, physical assembly only involves post-3D printing model processing. Users are recommended to export the model in STL or OBJ format after modeling and print using a 3D printer. After printing, optional steps include Micro:bit programming, physical model sanding, and coloring to enhance the model's quality, appearance, and interactivity.
