# Singing Chiikawa

## What is this?

The "Chiikawa Project" is an introductory 3D modeling teaching plan launched by Future Makers, aimed at guiding students to create adorable Chiikawa character models using the Nomad Sculpt application. Through simple and easy-to-understand steps, even beginners can easily master digital sculpting techniques and 3D print their created characters.

## What you will learn?

- Master the basic operations and modeling process of Nomad Sculpt
- Learn symmetrical modeling, shape deformation, and detail sculpting techniques
- Understand how to use reference images for modeling
- Learn to add colors and perform post-visual processing
- Understand model export and 3D printing preparation
- Develop spatial thinking and digital creation skills

## What you need

### Software and Equipment

- iPad or Android tablet
- Nomad Sculpt application (recommended to use with a stylus)
- Reference images of Chiikawa characters
- (Optional) 3D printer for printing the completed model

## How it works

The modeling process is divided into the following steps:

1. **Preparation Stage**: Launch Nomad Sculpt, create a new project, import the front reference image of Chiikawa, and adjust transparency and position.
2. **Basic Modeling**: Use a sphere as the base for the head, adjust shapes using "Gizmo" and "Move" tools, and add body, ears, tail, and limbs.
3. **Create Other Characters**: Save the current model as a new file, modify ear shapes, add or adjust the tail, and perform position and deformation adjustments.
4. **Add Details**: Use "Clay" or "Inflate" tools to sculpt character features and perform proportion checks.
5. **Coloring and Post-processing**: Add colors to the model and perform post-visual processing.
6. **Completion and Export**: After completing the model, export it in a format suitable for 3D printing.

## Design

This project focuses on the Chiikawa character, combining popular culture and digital modeling to enhance students' learning motivation. Through imitation and creation, students can not only learn modeling skills but also develop creative thinking and design abilities.

## Assembly Guide

Since this project mainly focuses on digital modeling, physical assembly only involves post-processing of the 3D printed model. It is recommended that users export the model as STL or OBJ format after completing the modeling and use a 3D printer for printing. After printing, post-processing steps such as polishing and coloring can be performed to enhance the texture and appearance of the model.

## Course Plan

The suggested course schedule is as follows:

- **Day 1**: Introduce Nomad Sculpt and Chiikawa characters, and perform basic modeling.
- **Day 2**: Further sculpt details, learn symmetrical modeling and shape deformation.
- **Day 3**: Add colors and perform post-visual processing.
- **Day 4**: Export the model and prepare for 3D printing, and perform post-processing of the physical model.

## Course Objectives

- Enable students to master basic 3D modeling skills
- Cultivate students' creative thinking and design abilities
- Enhance students' digital literacy and spatial imagination
- Encourage students to transform digital works into physical models

## Course Structure

This course adopts a modular teaching approach, combining theory and practice. Through step-by-step guidance and hands-on operation, students can master the core skills of 3D modeling in a short time. The course content is flexible and can be adjusted according to students' learning progress and interests, suitable for classroom teaching or self-study.
