# **Lesson Plan: Getting to Know Nomad Sculpt**

## Lesson Overview
- **Subject:** STEAM
- **Topic:** Getting to Know Nomad Sculpt
- **Target:** Primary Year 4 students
- **Duration:** 55 minutes (5 + 25 + 15 + 10)

## Required Materials
### Teacher Preparation
- Projector
- Demonstration videos
- Tablet with Nomad Sculpt installed
- Electronic pen (stylus)
- 3D model file of Moai statue
- Game cards

### Student Materials
- Tablet with Nomad Sculpt installed
- Stylus/Electronic pen
- Exercise reference cards

## Teaching Process

1. **Introduction (5 mins)**
   - Activities:
     - Explain that Nomad Sculpt is one of the tools available for creating 3D models through sculpting
   - Key Statements:
     - "Using Nomad Sculpt is like playing with clay inside a tablet. You mould and shape your 3D models with your fingers, just as you would with real clay, but without the mess."
   - Materials:
     - Play a short video (approximately 1 minute and 30 seconds) showcasing the final production to capture students' interest and inspire curiosity

2. **Development (25 mins)**
   - Activities:
     1. Control the screen perspective
     2. Get to know common sculpting tools
     3. Tune sculpting tools
     4. Restore sculpting effects
     5. File Processing and add new shape
   - Key Points:
     - Basic interface and operation
     - Identifying the direction using the cube
     - Returning to a previous step: the new action will replace all steps after this step (cannot be restored)
     - Most sculpting tools cannot be used before you press Validate
   - Materials:
     - Teachers can learn the operations from the demonstration videos in the teaching materials to play these videos in class

3. **Consolidation (15 mins)**
   - Exercise:
     - Follow the instructions on the game card to transform the Moai statue into different expressions or shapes
   - Key Points:
     - Familiarize with Nomad Sculpt
     - Use sculpting tools to transform Moai statues
     - Save the file and rename it as "exercise_class_name"
     - Be mindful: If students make the model too thin or damaged (appearing orange), it cannot be 3D printed
   - Materials:
     - Import the 3D model file of the Moai statue
     - Use game cards for further guidance

4. **Summary (10 mins)**
   - Activities:
     - Encourage students to present and share their completed projects, allowing them to demonstrate their creativity and skills
   - Key Points:
     - Encourage students to share what their task was on the game card and explain how they achieved it
     - Foster a culture of appreciation and learning from each other's creativity and efforts
   - Materials:
     - Projector for presentations
