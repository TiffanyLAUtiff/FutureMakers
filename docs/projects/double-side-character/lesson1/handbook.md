# **Handbook: Getting to Know Nomad Sculpt**

## **Welcome to Nomad!**

> Nomad is a 3D sculpting app that works best on tablets with a pressure-sensitive stylus, such as an Apple iPad and Pencil, or a Samsung Galaxy Tab with a stylus.

> Inspired by desktop sculpting apps like Zbrush and Blender, it focuses on an easy-to-understand UI without sacrificing features. If you've used 3D sculpting apps before, Nomad will feel very familiar.
