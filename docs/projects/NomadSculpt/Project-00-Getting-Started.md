## Welcome to Nomad!

Nomad is a 3D sculpting app that works best on tablets with a pressure sensitive stylus, 
eg an Apple iPad and pencil, or a Samsung Galaxy Tab with stylus.

It is inspired by desktop sculpting apps like Zbrush and Blender, with a focus on an easy to understand UI, without sacrificing on features. 
If you've used 3d sculpting apps before, Nomad will feel very familiar.

If this is your first time doing 3d sculpting, then it's good to know some basics.

## Your first sculpt

When you first start Nomad you'll see a sphere on screen. Simply drag your stylus on the sphere to start sculpting. 
Symmetry is enabled by default to make sculpting easier.

# Interface

## Nav Cube

A helper to show which side of the sculpt you're viewing, as well as a shortcut to jump to different views. 
Tapping the cube will jump the view to the tapped side. Dragging the cube will rotate. 
Tap the small icons next to the cube to frame the current object or reset to the default home view.

## Top menus

The menus in Nomad give you access to most of its features. The top-left menus mainly cover scene and object features, while the top-right menus are related to tools. On smaller screens, these menus will collapse together to save space. 

### Stats
This section provides information about the scene, the current object, mask status, and memory usage.

## Left toolbar
Sliders for radius and intensity for most tools, context-specific buttons for other tools, and shortcuts for symmetry, the tool alt/sub mode, masking, smoothing, the gizmo, and paint options.

## Bottom toolbar
Shortcuts for commonly used features are explained below.

## Toolbox

Nomad's tools are accessible from this scrollable region.
