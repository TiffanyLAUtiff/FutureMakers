## Welcome to Nomad!

Nomad is a 3D sculpting app that works best on tablets with a pressure sensitive stylus, 
eg an Apple iPad and pencil, or a Samsung Galaxy Tab with stylus.

It is inspired by desktop sculpting apps like Zbrush and Blender, with a focus on an easy to understand UI, without sacrificing on features. 
If you've used 3d sculpting apps before, Nomad will feel very familiar.

If this is your first time doing 3d sculpting, then it's good to know some basics.

## Your first sculpt

When you first start Nomad you'll see a sphere on screen. Simply drag your stylus on the sphere to start sculpting. 
Symmetry is enabled by default to make sculpting easier.

# Interface

## Nav Cube

A helper to show which side of the sculpt you're viewing, as well as a shortcut to jump to different views. 
Tapping the cube will jump the view to the tapped side. Dragging the cube will rotate. 
Tap the small icons next to the cube to frame the current object or reset to the default home view.

### Three Gestures to Control the View of Screen

## Top menus

The menus in Nomad give you access to most of its features. The top-left menus mainly cover scene and object features, while the top-right menus are related to tools. On smaller screens, these menus will collapse together to save space. 

### Stats
This section provides information about the scene, the current object, mask status, and memory usage.

## Left toolbar
Sliders for radius and intensity for most tools, context-specific buttons for other tools, and shortcuts for symmetry, the tool alt/sub mode, masking, smoothing, the gizmo, and paint options.

## Bottom toolbar
Shortcuts for commonly used features are explained below.

## Toolbox

Nomad's tools are accessible from this scrollable region.

# Tools

## Overview

Nomad has many tools that can be broadly categorized as follows: 

- Brush tools that directly affect the surface of an object, eg Clay
- Mask tools that will protect the surface from changes, eg Mask
- Selection based tools where a 2d mask is drawn first, then an operation happens, eg Trim
- Special tools with their own interaction methods, eg Tube

Many of these tools can be customized with different brush behavior, pressure, textures etc via the Stroke menu.

## Tool controls

![P0-09.png](https://github.com/beets3d/FutureMakers/blob/main/docs/projects/NomadSculpt/Images/P0-11.png)

The panel on the left side of the screen controls the tool radius and intensity, and hotkeys specific to certain tools, explained in each tool's help section below.

### TIP

The intensity slider for many tools can go above 100%, worth experimenting with!

## Tool context menu 

A right click or long press on a tool will bring up a context menu. 

This menu has the following options:

- Save:       save any changes you made to the tool 
- Clone:      duplicate the tool into a new tool shortcut
- Last save:  revert to the previously saved version of the tool
- Icon:       change the icon for the tool 
- Reset:      reset the tool to its defaults

# Common Sculpting Tools
