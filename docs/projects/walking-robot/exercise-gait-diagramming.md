### **Exercise: Gait Diagramming**  
**Objective:** Compare bipedal (human) and hexapod (insect) gait patterns to understand how limb coordination affects stability and energy efficiency.  

---

#### **Materials Needed:**  
- Printed gait cycle templates (human walking/running, insect crawling).  
- Projector/screen (to show slow-motion videos of human/insect movement).  
- Markers, paper, or whiteboards for sketching.  

---

#### **Step-by-Step Instructions:**  
1. **Introduction to Gait Phases (10 min)**  
   - Explain key terms:  
     - **Stance phase**: Foot on the ground.  
     - **Swing phase**: Foot in motion.  
     - **Stride length**: Distance between consecutive steps.  
   - Show slow-motion videos of a human walking and an insect (e.g., ant) moving.  

2. **Human Gait Analysis (15 min)**  
   - Students sketch a stick-figure diagram of a human walking, breaking the motion into 4–6 frames.  
   - Highlight:  
     - Alternating leg movement.  
     - Role of arm swings in balance.  

3. **Insect Gait Analysis (15 min)**  
   - Diagram an insect's tripod gait (three legs touch the ground at once).  
   - Compare stability: *"Why don't insects tip over?"*  

4. **Group Discussion (10 min)**  
   - Compare diagrams: How do gait patterns relate to body structure?  
   - Discuss trade-offs: Speed vs. stability, energy efficiency.

| Alternating leg motion (left-right-left). | Three legs move in sync (front/back left + middle right). |  

---

#### **Key Learning Outcomes**  
- Identify how **limb coordination** impacts stability and speed.  
- Connect natural gaits to robotic design challenges (e.g., *"Why might a robot need 6 legs instead of 2?"*).  
- Introduce **gait optimization** (energy efficiency vs. stability).  

---

#### **Differentiation for Ages**  
- **Ages 11–13**: Focus on simple leg sequencing (e.g., *"left-right-left"*).  
- **Ages 14–17**: Add math concepts (e.g., calculate stride length/duty factor).  

---

#### **Assessment**  
- Evaluate diagrams for accuracy in representing gait phases.  
- Reflection question: *"Which gait is better for rocky terrain? Why?"*  

---

#### **Extension Activity**  
- Design a **hybrid gait** for a fictional animal/robot and explain choices.
