### **Exercise: Teeter-Totter Test**  
**Objective:** Demonstrate how weight distribution and torque affect a robot's stability.  

---

#### **Materials Needed:**  
- Assembled B3D1 robot (or chassis-only if unpowered).  
- LEGO weights (e.g., bricks, metal coins, or clay).  
- Fulcrum base (e.g., wooden block, ruler, or 3D-printed pivot).  
- Ruler/measuring tape.  

---

#### **Step-by-Step Instructions:**  
1. **Setup the Teeter-Totter (10 min)**  
   - Place a ruler or flat plank over a fulcrum (e.g., wooden block).  
   - Position the robot horizontally on the plank.

2. **Baseline Balance Test (10 min)**  
   - Observe where the robot balances naturally without added weights.  
   - Mark the **center of gravity (CoG)** with a sticker or pencil.  

3. **Weight Adjustment Experiment (20 min)**  
   - Attach LEGO weights to different robot parts (front/back/sides).  
   - Test how each modification shifts the CoG:  
     - Example: *"Add 50g to the robot's head – does it tip forward?"*  

4. **Torque Calculation (Advanced, 10 min)**  
   - Use formula: **Torque = Weight × Distance from Fulcrum**.  
   - Compare torque values for different weight placements.

#### **Example Scenarios**  
| **Weight Placement** | **Effect on Balance** | **Torque Calculation**     |  
|-----------------------|-----------------------|----------------------------|  
| Back legs             | Tips backward         | `50g × 5cm = 250 g·cm`     |  
| Front legs            | Tips forward          | `50g × 8cm = 400 g·cm`     |  

---

#### **Key Learning Outcomes**  
- **Balance**: Understand how weight distribution impacts stability.  
- **Torque**: Learn how force × distance creates rotational effects.  
- **Design Insight**: Optimize payload placement for real-world robots.  

---

#### **Differentiation for Ages**  
- **Ages 11–13**: Focus on qualitative observations (e.g., *"heavier side tips down"*).  
- **Ages 14–17**: Calculate torque and graph results (torque vs. distance).  

---

#### **Discussion Questions**  
- *"Where should you place a heavy sensor to keep the robot stable?"*  
- *"Why do construction cranes have counterweights?"*  

---

#### **Assessment**  
- Submit a diagram showing CoG shifts and explain findings.  

---

#### **Extension Activity**  
- Design a LEGO *"backpack"* to keep the robot balanced on a slope.
