# Walking Robot Project

## What is this?
![Walking Robot Overview](images/robot-overview.jpg)


A walking crank robot that demonstrates fundamental walking mechanism concepts through hands-on experimentation. This educational platform allows students and teachers to explore how different physical attributes affect robot locomotion. By modifying key components like leg length and foot design using LEGO blocks, students can investigate:

- Walking speed and efficiency
- Robot stability and balance
- Different walking gaits and patterns


Understanding the concepts of walking mechanisms, balance, and motion dynamics is crucial for developing a deeper understanding of robotics. For details, please refer to the [Concepts of Walking](concept-of-walking.md) page.

Key Features:

- Modular design compatible with LEGO blocks for easy modification
- Basic walking functions (forward/backward movement)
- Remote control capability
- Customizable foot attachments for experimenting with different designs
- Adjustable leg lengths to explore optimal walking configurations

Key Components:

- Micro:bit x 2
- Main board x 1
- geared motors x 2
- motor driver board x1
- Battery pack
- Jumper wires
- 3D printed parts
- Outter shell
- LEGO blocks

The robot serves as an excellent teaching tool for understanding mechanical principles, robotics fundamentals, and the relationship between design choices and movement outcomes.
