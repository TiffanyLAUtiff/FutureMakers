# Walking Robot Project

## What is this?
A beginner-friendly project where students build a walking robot using servo motors and an Arduino. The robot uses a simple mechanical leg design to create walking movements, teaching fundamental concepts of robotics and engineering through hands-on building.

## What you will learn
- **Electronics**: Basic circuits, servo motor control, Arduino programming
- **Engineering**: Mechanical design, walking mechanisms, gear systems
- **Design Skills**: CAD modeling, prototyping, iterative design
- **Fabrication**: 3D printing, basic tool usage, assembly techniques
- **Programming**: Arduino IDE, basic coding concepts
- **Soft Skills**: Problem-solving, teamwork, documentation

## What you need

### Hardware
- 1x Arduino Uno
- 4x SG90 Servo Motors
- 1x Servo Driver Board (PCA9685)
- 1x Battery Pack (6V)
- Jumper wires
- USB cable

### Software
- Arduino IDE
- Tinkercad (for 3D design)
- Servo motor library

### Age
Suitable for ages 11-14
