# 3D Sculpt AI Project 

---

## What is this?

Combining Art and Technologies, this project is bringing your 3D sculpture to live with GenAI. You will unleash your creativity to create your favorite 3D sculpture using just an iPAD, and then give it a soul by using GenAI. So it can talk and interact with you. Learners can explore:

- 3D modelling in particular sculpting
- Post processing and color of 3D model
- Build AI powered chatbot
    - Speech Reconition model
    - Text to Speech model
    - AI response using LLM or AI generated rule based response
- Raspberry Pi 
- Coding in Python

### Key Features:

- Base framework / model to build around the technology
-  


The 3D Sculpt AI project acts as a powerful educational resource, enabling learners to grasp essential art principles, foundational concepts in AI, and the intricate connections between technology and art.

### The Design Process



**3D Modeling**
   - Create and refine 3D models using software tools. Participants will learn techniques for manipulating shapes, textures, and colors to achieve desired outcomes.

**3D Printing**
   - Prepare models for printing using slicing software, which converts 3D designs into instructions for the printer. Participants will understand the importance of settings such as layer height, infill, and support structures.
